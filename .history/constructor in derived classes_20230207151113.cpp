/* Constructors in derived classes*/

// if base class does not have any arguments there is no need of any constructor in dervied class

// but in case of parametrized constructor in base class. you need to pass parameterized constructor in derived class.

// if both base class and derived class have constructor. The base class constructor will execute first.
